/*
 * Changelog:
 *
 * 1.0 - Initial release
 * 1.1 - Made empty cells get initialized with 0xffff... instead of zeros
 *       when the simulation starts. This makes things more consistent with
 *       the way the output buf is treated for self-replication, though
 *       the initial state rapidly becomes irrelevant as the simulation
 *       gets going.  Also made one or two very minor performance fixes.
 * 1.2 - Added statistics for execution frequency and metabolism, and made
 *       the visualization use 16bpp color.
 * 1.3 - Added a few other statistics.
 * 1.4 - Replaced SET with KILL and changed EAT to SHARE. The SHARE idea
 *       was contributed by Christoph Groth (http://www.falma.de/). KILL
 *       is a variation on the original EAT that is easier for cells to
 *       make use of.
 * 1.5 - Made some other instruction changes such as XCHG and added a
 *       penalty for failed KILL attempts. Also made access permissions
 *       stochastic.
 * 1.6 - Made cells all start facing in direction 0. This removes a bit
 *       of artificiality and requires cells to evolve the ability to
 *       turn in various directions in order to reproduce in anything but
 *       a straight line. It also makes pretty graphics.
 * 1.7 - Added more statistics, such as original lineage, and made the
 *       genome dump files CSV files as well.
 * 1.8 - Fixed LOOP/REP bug reported by user Sotek.  Thanks!  Also
 *       reduced the default mutation rate a bit.
 * 1.9 - Added a bunch of changes suggested by Christoph Groth: a better
 *       coloring algorithm, right click to switch coloring schemes (two
 *       are currently supported), and a few speed optimizations. Also
 *       changed visualization so that cells with generations less than 2
 *       are no longer shown.
 * 2.0 - Rewrite for performance optimization:
 *		Use SFMT library for batch random number generation
 *		MPI and OpenMP parallelization
 *		Code cleanup
